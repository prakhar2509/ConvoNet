![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

A modern, multithreaded client-server chat application built with **C++20** that provides secure real-time communication using SSL/TLS encryption. ConvoNet enables multiple clients to connect to a centralized server for encrypted group messaging.

## üåü Features

- **üîê SSL/TLS Encryption**: All communication between clients and server is encrypted using OpenSSL
- **üë• Multi-Client Support**: Server handles multiple concurrent clients using multithreading
- **üí¨ Real-time Messaging**: Instant message broadcasting to all connected users
- **üöÄ Cross-Platform**: Supports both Windows and Linux/Unix systems
- **üè∑Ô∏è Username System**: Users can set custom usernames for identification
- **üì§ Private Messaging**: Framework for direct user-to-user communication (expandable)
- **üîå Graceful Connection Handling**: Proper client connect/disconnect notifications
- **üßµ Thread-Safe Architecture**: Concurrent client management with mutex protection

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Specifications

- **Language**: C++20
- **Build System**: CMake (minimum 3.10, tested with 3.31.6)
- **Generator**: Ninja
- **Dependencies**: OpenSSL, Threads library
- **Networking**: TCP sockets with SSL/TLS layer
- **Architecture**: Multi-threaded server with thread-safe client management
- **Platform Support**: Windows (Winsock), Linux/Unix (POSIX sockets)

## üìã Prerequisites

Before building ConvoNet, ensure you have the following installed:

### Required Dependencies

- **C++20 compatible compiler**:
  - GCC 10+ (Linux/macOS)
  - Clang 12+ (Linux/macOS)
  - MSVC 2019+ (Windows)
- **CMake** 3.10 or higher
- **OpenSSL** development libraries
- **Ninja** build system (recommended)

### Installing Dependencies

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build libssl-dev
```

#### CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
```bash
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo yum install cmake ninja-build openssl-devel
```

#### macOS (with Homebrew)
```bash
brew install cmake ninja openssl
```

#### Windows
- Install Visual Studio 2019+ with C++ development tools
- Download and install OpenSSL from [OpenSSL for Windows](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
- Install CMake from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/)
- Install Ninja: `choco install ninja` (with Chocolatey) or download from [ninja-build.org](https://ninja-build.org/)

## üöÄ Installation & Build

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prakhar2509/ConvoNet.git
cd ConvoNet
```

### Step 2: Generate SSL Certificates

Before running the server, you need to generate SSL certificates. Navigate to the `server/` directory:

```bash
cd server
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
```

When prompted, you can use the following example values:
- **Country Name**: US
- **State or Province Name**: California
- **Locality Name**: San Francisco
- **Organization Name**: ConvoNet
- **Common Name**: localhost

### Step 3: Build the Project

From the project root directory:

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

For traditional make:
```bash
cmake -B build
make -C build
```

#### Windows Build Notes

If OpenSSL is installed in a custom location:
```cmd
cmake -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR="C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64" -B build
cmake --build build
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Starting the Server

From the build directory:
```bash
./server
```

The server will start listening on port 8080 by default and display:
```
Server started on port 8080
```

### Connecting Clients

In separate terminal windows, connect clients using:
```bash
./client
```

For local testing:
```bash
./client localhost
```

### Example Session

**Server Output:**
```
[INFO] Client connected: Alice
[INFO] Client connected: Bob
[INFO] Alice: Hello, everyone!
[INFO] Bob: Hi Alice!
```

**Client Output (Alice):**
```
Welcome to ConvoNet!
Enter your username: Alice
[Bob]: Hi Alice!
```

**Client Output (Bob):**
```
Welcome to ConvoNet!
Enter your username: Bob
[Alice]: Hello, everyone!
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Server Architecture
- **Main Thread**: Accepts incoming SSL connections on port 8080
- **Client Threads**: Each connected client is handled by a dedicated thread using `std::thread`
- **Thread Safety**: Client list and username mapping protected by `std::mutex`
- **SSL Context**: Shared SSL context (`SSL_CTX*`) for all client connections
- **Message Broadcasting**: Thread-safe message distribution to all connected clients

### Client Architecture
- **Main Thread**: Handles user input and sends messages to server
- **Receive Thread**: Continuously listens for incoming messages from server using `std::thread`
- **SSL Connection**: Maintains encrypted connection to server with automatic reconnection handling
- **User Interface**: Simple terminal-based interface with real-time message display

### Message Flow
1. Client establishes SSL connection to server
2. Server requests username, client responds
3. Server broadcasts join notification to all other clients
4. Messages are broadcast to all connected clients except sender
5. Server handles graceful disconnections and notifies remaining clients

### Key Components
- **`Server` class**: Manages SSL context, client connections, and message broadcasting
- **`Client` class**: Handles SSL connection, message sending/receiving, and user input
- **SSL/TLS layer**: Encrypts all communication using OpenSSL
- **Cross-platform sockets**: Windows (Winsock) and Unix (POSIX) compatibility

## üîí Security Features

### SSL/TLS Implementation
- **Protocol**: TLS 1.2+ (OpenSSL default configuration)
- **Certificate**: Self-signed X.509 certificate (can be replaced with CA-signed)
- **Key Size**: RSA 4096-bit encryption
- **Certificate Validation**: Server certificate validation (configurable)
- **Cipher Suites**: Modern cipher suites with forward secrecy

### Security Considerations
- Private keys (`key.pem`) are automatically excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- SSL context properly initialized with secure defaults
- Memory is properly cleared after use with `memset`
- Connection timeouts and comprehensive error handling implemented
- Thread-safe operations prevent race conditions

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

### Development Guidelines
1. Follow C++20 standards and best practices
2. Ensure thread-safe implementations
3. Add appropriate error handling
4. Update documentation for new features
5. Test on multiple platforms when possible
